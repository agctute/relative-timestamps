# Relative Timestamps Obsidian Plugin

**Note**: This plugin was made for personal use and is very barebones right now. Any contributions would be appreciated.

Originally made for use in food logs, diaries, and other notes where it may be difficult to grasp the time span between two entries at a glance. For instance, without pausing to think, one might not immediately realize the significant gap between a 3 AM entry and a 6 PM entry. This plugin addresses this by automatically inserting the time that has passed between timestamps. 

## Features

- Set the timestamp to be used as the last point of reference (you can set the time to the current time with the 'Reset timestamp' command)
- Insert the current time along with the time that has passed
- The plugin is very rigid in it's current state, and any setting additions to format are welcome.
